#summary Hidden Object Game Clicker

= Introduction =

Basically an automated clicker program to play hidden object games where you take a screenshot, select the points you would like to click in a row,
then executing the clicks by sending mouse events to the original game window. This way, you can finish a screen faster, achieve bonuses for successful subsequent clicks, etc. Note that some clicking may trigger a different game state (e.g. a popup, storytelling, reward) which breaks the click sequence. You have to re-capture the frame, delete objects already clicked then re-run for the rest.

You should run the program in administrator privileges.

Best option is to run your HOG game in windowed mode and start the Windows' *Magnifier* tool. Zooming in is one of the best option for these games.
